## Live Demo
https://restaurant-reservation-front-c1e0.onrender.com

## Application Summary
A restaurant reservation system used to create and edit reservations, as well as assign a table to the reservation once the customer has arrived.
Once a table has finished with their dining experience, the user of the reservation app can change the status of the table back to "free" for future use.
Users can also search for a reservation by phone number and create new tables to accomodate party sizes.
This app was built using JavaScript, React, Express, Node, PostgreSQL, Knex, HTML, and Bootstrap. 

## Screenshots
Dashboard:
Lists the reservations for the day & the tables. If a table is occupied, a "finish" button appears under the complete column to allow the user to free up the table for another guest.
